All I am doing is make them useable on Uplay, Regards.

# Rainbow Six: Siege Hacks / Mods

## Important:
**For People having issues with alloc() in the original scripts** Please try the version_2 of the scripts. It should solve the issue for you.

**Note:** These scripts have only been tested for the steam version of the game. I don't have the Uplay version, nor do I have interest in buying a second copy of the game to test these / adapt these to Uplay version.

Requirements: 
CheatEngine (Latest) - Available @ www.cheatengine.org
Stealth Edit - Available @ http://guidedhacking.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3697&d=1476658637 (Requires Login)
I've tried other versions, they seem to crash the game, So I recommend this version.

I hope these cheats are only used in PvE mode. I will stop updating this if I think people are using them in Ranked / PvP.

You must have BattleEye disabled / not running to use these cheats (atleast without getting the ban hammer). If you don't know how to disable BattleEye for RainbowSix these scripts might not be for you. Regardless, you can find out how to disable BattleEye on mpgh.net.
